# MMTeX

This repository contains build instructions for MMTeX, a minimal modern
(Lua)TeX distribution.

MMTeX provides only one format - OpTeX. TeXlive's plain LuaTeX used to be
provided as well, but diverged enough to be left out.

The repository of MMTeX is at https://github.com/vlasakm/mmtex.

# Documentation

See `doc/old-mmtex-doc.tex`, an older document, for motivation and some design
decisions.

Build and install instructions are also there and up to date, but the user
guide is not. Currently the focus and design is shifting towards having only
one format using only modern font mechanisms.
